Hello World!  This is the start of a blog I will be doing in conjunction with my attempts to become a data scientist. I am currently working in my first job out of college as a business analyst for a government contractor in the Dc Metro area.  It pays well and I like the company I work for but this isn’t the career I aspired to in college.  I majored in economics and immediately went into a 1-year MBA concentrating in business analytics.  It was those last few years of school that I realized I truly wanted to get involved in these buzzword jobs like “analytics” and “big data”.  And while I may not have landed the data scientist role out of college, I have learned more about what it takes to land this dream job and the things I will still need to accomplish to make myself marketable.
Below are the job requirements for a “Junior Data Scientist” position at the company I work for.  I may be selling myself short--and I will reassess as time goes on—but I see this role as my best foot in the doorway to my data science career.  For each bullet point I will shortly write how I will work to meet the requirements in the coming months: 
•Bachelor’s or Advanced degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Accounting, Economic, Finance or other technical disciplines 
Cha-ching! I knew that Economics degree would pay off.  I even have an advanced degree I can try to leverage.

• 1+ year of relevant consulting or industry experience in financial analysis, transformation or strategic initiatives
I have been working as a consultant for 6 months, giving me a 6-month time frame for the earliest possible application to this job.  Again, the advanced degree could add a little extra here.
 
• Proficiency in word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation creation tools, as well as Internet research tools 
Business school and being a millennial give this one.  3 for 3!

• Strong orientation to quantitative, data-driven analysis using stats packages such as SAS (modeler, statistics, text analytics); STATA; or SPSS; MATLAB; R 
I have used every one of these packages in one class or another.  I think, according to the wording of the requirement, I could explain in an interview my understanding of these.  Also, I will expand on where I want to expand any proficiencies that may fall under this requirement in ones below

• Proficient in SAS reporting tools 
This one may be the only requirement I won’t pursue.  I worked as a grad student for a professor using SAS but the program is just too expensive to get your hands on if it isn’t provided by an outside institution.  I may be well paid but I’m not THAT well paid.

• Understanding of Oracle database, Relational Database, Unstructured Data 
I work in SQL every day for my job and I plan to only get better in the coming months.  I also plan on making a database of my own for some of the projects I have in mind.

• Ability to code in PL/SQL and R. 
Now we are getting to the meet of my preparations.  As I mentioned earlier, I have worked with R before.  I am a far cry from the programmer I need to be though and, starting immediately after finishing this blog post, I will be using Data Camp to hone my skills and to focus them in the field of data analytics.  Yeah, yeah.  I know someone reading this is wondering why, with the internet as vast as it is, I would pay someone to teach me R.  I thought it was idiotic at first two.  But the decision is a bet in my penny-pinching ways.  I am gambling on the idea that paying for Data Camp will ensure I use data camp (I also pay for Planet Fitness too.  Why do you ask?).

• US citizenship or Permanent Resident with the ability to obtain and maintain a Public Trust Clearance required 
Check and check.
 
• Exceptional attention to detail and proven ability to identify process improvement opportunities 
I hope the fruits of my labor these next few months prove this one to be true.

• Advanced statistics and machine learning/NLP techniques and algorithms using R, Python, Java on ML platforms such as Spark, H20 etc. 
The class that finally helped me turn the switch from buzzwords about data to an actual understanding of the career path was a graduate level CS class on data mining I took as an elective.  We used Python in the class and I spent the first 3rd of the semester on learning the basics of programming before I even got into the class material.  All this to say, I know a little Python and I know a little machine learning.  In the effort to learn more I hope to be able to also take a short Python course on Data Camp, if only to point to it as another qualification.  To continue to learn about machine learning I have already begun listening to Andrew Ng’s video course on Coursera. I doubt you can find anyone who doesn’t recommend learning about machine learning from him.  I know little about Spark and H20 but they are points of interest of mine if I get confident enough to start handling big datasets

• Prior experience using financial data and with federal consulting
Another check to round everything off.
I am so excited that this job was posted by my company.  Even if the above was an exercise in redundancy (and humble bragging.  Look at how many I already meet!) it still lays out exactly what I need to do in the coming months to guide my path toward being a quality candidate.  In addition to the steps I am taking above, I am also going to be attempting to build a portfolio of my work on a GitHub repository to show off my work.  I will expand on some project ideas in future posts.  In the meantime, it’s time for me to get working!
